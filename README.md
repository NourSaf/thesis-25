## Abstract
Since Germany’s unification in 1990, political divisions between the former East and West have persisted, with recent elections highlighting a resurgence of ideological fragmentation. The rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), founded in 2013, has been particularly pronounced in eastern states, raising concerns about the country’s political trajectory. This thesis investigates how far-right rhetoric, specifically the speeches of AfD leader Alice Weidel, reinforces and deepens these divisions.

Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and topic classification models, this study analyzes Weidel’s speeches to identify recurring themes such as nationalism, anti-elite sentiment, and immigration. A predictive model is developed to assess whether other political parties are shifting towards right-wing populist discourse over time, estimating their likelihood of adopting similar rhetoric in future elections. The findings provide insights into whether Germany is moving toward increased polarization and explore potential interventions to counteract this trend. By combining computational text analysis, electoral data visualization, and predictive modeling, this research contributes to the broader discourse on the evolving landscape of German politics and the future of ideological alignment in Europe.

## Introduction Page
The introduction page will show a brief history of Germany's map. Before 1990, after 1990 and today, to highlight the probelm.

## Intorduction 
Media—whether written, printed, or voice-recorded—has long been a tool for spreading new ideas, perspectives, and ideologies. During World War II, broadcasting played a central role. In the U.S., for example, 90% of households owned radios, which allowed the government to use direct communication tactics, such as the "you technique," to connect with the public and make them feel involved in the war effort. Meanwhile, Nazi Germany broadcasted propaganda for up to 11 hours daily, targeting groups like capitalists, Jews, and certain media outlets and politicians.<sup>1</sup>

Media's role in driving change has not been limited to government actions throughout history. In 2001, approximately seven million text messages with the message “Go 2 EDSA. Wear Black” were sent via cell phones, which played a crucial role in the ousting of Philippine President Joseph Estrada.<sup>2</sup> This movement showed how mobile technology could mobilize the public and bring about political change. This event marked the first large-scale civilian movement organized via social media, highlighting its potential as a political tool that reshapes political landscapes and holds power to account. Social media enables faster connections, news exchange, and organization. Inspired by the Philippine movement, similar frameworks were adopted worldwide. Ten years later, the rapid development and accessibility of communication tools led to the 2011 Egyptian protests, where Facebook and Twitter played pivotal roles in sparking a revolution that continues to impact Egypt's political landscape.<sup>3</sup>

Germany has seen a rise in the popularity of the far-right party in recent years, with its ideologies targeting migrants. Recently, the long-standing "firewall" policy against far-right groups since World War II was weakened to appeal to voters opposed to immigration. This shift has led to increased tensions, with political parties blaming each other for the growing influence of the Alternative for Germany (AfD).<sup>4</sup>

In this paper, we explore the following questions: How is the right-wing party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), gaining popularity through social media? What strategies are they using? What ideologies are they promoting? Who is their target audience? Which social media platforms are they utilizing? What role does artificial intelligence play in their campaigns?




## Sketches
### Webpage Structure 
The main Idea is to have as little pages as possible to the user stays engaged wiht the analysis. 
Therefore, there is only three pages.
1. Landing page with intial information about the project and introductory visualization. 
2. Analysis page: contains in deepth analysis of the subject matter.
3. About page, having informtion about the project credits and data sources and methodologies.

### Landing page
Here and for now, there is two ideas: 
1. Steam-graph: visualizing the history of the AfD and information about popularity over time.
2. A map and time line: showing, when and where did the AfD started. Over time, how is the number of votes is changing, where are they getting popular.
3. Potentialy: informaiton about ages of groups. 
![Landing Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/932113fc-6bb4-4ab5-92f3-9927cc853d37)

### In depth analysis page
This is the main analysis page, it includes: 
1. Posts/Videos/speech analysis of Alice Weidel the co-chairwoman of the far-right party AfD in Germany and the party's lead candidat.
2. Barcharts group descriping in percent the topics she speaks about.
3. Drop down menu to chose between Alice Weidel the first person and the second top person in the Party.
4. A switcher to chose between seeing a visual abstracion of the analysis or to see the original scripted speech.
The main goal of this page to make the user engaged in the story and explore with drop down and filter options
