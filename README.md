## Abstract
The far-right parties are always aim to divide opinions within countries. They cause harm to marginalized communities and create tensions with other nations. Over the past decade, Europe has witnessed a significant rise in far-right parties. In Germany, the 2025 federal elections demonstrated an unprecedented surge in support for the country's far-right party. Election maps displayed a geographical split that mirrored the pre-reunification divide of Germany before 1990. This thesis investigates how the rhetoric of the far-right party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), contributed to this division. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence to transcribe 190 speeches and interviews by Alice Weidel, the party's leader, this research employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) to categorize far-right political discourse. The model developed in this study can identify far-right rhetoric even when parties do not explicitly declare their affiliation. The broader goal is to develop an early warning system to detect political parties that may adopt far-right ideologies and rhetoric to gain voter support.

## Introduction Page
The introduction page will show a brief history of Germany's map. Before 1990, after 1990 and today, to highlight the probelm. 
Addtionally, the page will show the raise of AfD party and the voters trend over time. 
Finally, the page will present other factors that plays a role in the division we are seeing on the maps today.

## Intorduction 
Media—whether written, printed, or voice-recorded—has long been a powerful tool for spreading ideas, shaping public opinion, and influencing political ideologies. Throughout history, governments and political movements have strategically utilized media to mobilize support, consolidate power, and manipulate public perception. During World War II, for instance, radio broadcasting played a crucial role in propaganda dissemination. In the United States, 90% of households owned a radio, allowing the government to engage the public through direct communication tactics, such as the “you technique,” which fostered a sense of personal involvement in the war effort. Meanwhile, Nazi Germany broadcasted propaganda for up to 11 hours daily, targeting groups such as capitalists, Jews, and political opponents to manipulate national sentiment and reinforce its authoritarian regime. 

Beyond government propaganda, media has also been a catalyst for political resistance and social movements. In 2001, approximately seven million text messages with the phrase “Go 2 EDSA. Wear Black” were circulated via mobile phones in the Philippines, mobilizing mass protests that ultimately led to the ousting of President Joseph Estrada.  This event was one of the earliest examples of digital technology being used to orchestrate large-scale civilian movements, demonstrating how media can serve both as a tool of oppression and a vehicle for democratic resistance.

These historical examples highlight a critical commonality: language is the foundation of political influence. Whether through traditional broadcasting or digital platforms, political movements craft their rhetoric to shape public discourse, influence attitudes, and drive political outcomes. Today, the far-right in Germany is leveraging modern media—especially social media—to spread its ideology and reshape the political landscape.

On February 23, 2025, Germany’s federal election results was shockwaves across the country. The election map revealed a striking division that closely mirrored the historical East-West divide before reunification in 1990. For decades, Germany had worked to bridge this gap, fostering economic and social integration between the former East and West. However, the rise of the far-right party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), suggests that this division was never fully resolved. The electoral results indicate that far-right rhetoric played a significant role in reviving these divisions, raising critical questions about the power of political language in shaping national identity and public sentiment.

Recently, the long-standing "firewall" policy against far-right groups since World War II was weakened to appeal to voters opposed to immigration. This shift has led to increased tensions, with political parties blaming each other for the growing influence of the Alternative for Germany (AfD). 

Although correlation does not imply causation, the stark electoral divide and the division in the Germany’s parlament suggests a deeper sociopolitical rift that warrants further investigation. This study aims to analyze how the rhetoric of AfD—particularly the speeches of its leader, Alice Weidel—contributed to this division. By examining the language used in far-right discourse, this research seeks to understand the mechanisms through which political speech can reinforce ideological divides and mobilize support.

To investigate this phenomenon, this study employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to analyze the rhetoric of AfD. Specifically, it focuses on 190 TikTok videos featuring Alice Weidel, transcribing and categorizing the language used to construct a database of keywords and thematic categories. This analysis will help identify common linguistic patterns and the ideological frameworks that define far-right discourse in Germany.

Prior research has shown that video content has a profound psychological impact, often inducing “neural polarization,” which reinforces existing beliefs and intensifies ideological divides.  Social media platforms like TikTok, with their algorithmic amplification mechanisms, play a significant role in disseminating such content, making them fertile ground for political radicalization. After analyzing TikTok data, this study will expand to include other platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to gain a broader perspective on far-right digital rhetoric.
By systematically examining the language used by AfD, this research aims to address the following questions:
•	How does the rhetoric of far-right parties contribute to societal division?
•	What linguistic patterns define far-right discourse in Germany?
•	How do digital platforms amplify and reinforce far-right narratives?
•	Can an AI-driven model be developed to identify emerging political parties that adopt far-right rhetoric without explicitly declaring their ideological stance?

However, this research, unfortuenately, will not be able to deal with the algorithims of any platform and how this views are gaind and if there is any paid online campagins.

Through computational analysis and discourse evaluation, this study seeks to contribute to broader discussions on algorithmic propaganda, political misinformation, and the role of digital media in shaping public opinion. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial in developing strategies to counter extremist narratives and mitigate the social divisions they create.
 
## Sketches
### Webpage Structure 
The main Idea is to have as little pages as possible to the user stays engaged wiht the analysis. 
Therefore, there is only three pages.
1. Landing page with intial information about the project and introductory visualization. 
2. Analysis page: contains in deepth analysis of the subject matter.
3. About page, having informtion about the project credits and data sources and methodologies.

### Landing page
Here and for now, there is two ideas: 
1. Steam-graph: visualizing the history of the AfD and information about popularity over time.
2. A map and time line: showing, when and where did the AfD started. Over time, how is the number of votes is changing, where are they getting popular.
3. Potentialy: informaiton about ages of groups. 
![Landing Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/932113fc-6bb4-4ab5-92f3-9927cc853d37)

### In depth analysis page
This is the main analysis page, it includes: 
1. Posts/Videos/speech analysis of Alice Weidel the co-chairwoman of the far-right party AfD in Germany and the party's lead candidat.
2. Barcharts group descriping in percent the topics she speaks about.
3. Drop down menu to chose between Alice Weidel the first person and the second top person in the Party.
4. A switcher to chose between seeing a visual abstracion of the analysis or to see the original scripted speech.
The main goal of this page to make the user engaged in the story and explore with drop down and filter options
